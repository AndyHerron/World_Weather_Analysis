# World_Weather_Analysis
module 6

## Weather_Database folder
The Weather_Database folder contains the required elements and is inside the Vacation_Search folder.

## Jupyter Notebook vs. Visual Studio Code
My jupyter notebook is not displaying the maps.  When I run the exact same code in the same environment in Visual Studio it works perfectly.
